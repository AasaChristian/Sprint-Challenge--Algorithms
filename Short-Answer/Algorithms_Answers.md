#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(1):
I chose this complexity because this function will run the same time for all positive numbers and once for all negative numbers.  


b)
O(n^2)
I chose this complexity because every i in range n has to go thru the while loop.


c)O(n)
This is function will run n number of times.

## Exercise II
the building floor s would be an orderred list
I would find the mid point and drop a egg off
make a if else statment 
if the egg breaks: throw away top half a run function on lower half
if the egg doesn't break: run function on upper half
The base would stop the reccursive loop when n len is 1

O(log n)
The function halves n on every loop.
